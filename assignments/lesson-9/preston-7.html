            <h2>Developing Town: Preston Passionate for CV Pennant</h2>
            <h4>by Claudia Erickson Citizen Correspondent</h4>
          </div>

          <p>
            The Cache Valley Pennant was an item to be prized by the teams
            playing in that crazy year when Preston citizens of all ages and
            both genders were “nuts about baseball.” Feelings ran high and the
            editors of the local newspapers added fuel to the fire with their
            sports editorials from the south end of Cache Valley in Logan to the
            north with Preston’s diatribe. In the August 5, 1909 edition of the
            Preston News a headline read “Preston Robbed of Pennant“ and the
            following article stated facts (as seen from this side of the
            fence.) “The enmity of Cache Valley towns is plainly seen in the
            action taken ….A coterie of partisan baseball directors got together
            and by pooling their interests, literally robbed Preston of the
            Cache Valley Pennant. All year Preston has played the crowds, the
            umpires and policemen and never uttered a word of protest and even
            won a great majority of the games than any other team, but when it
            came to the final decision, Logan, Lewiston and Richmond got
            together and voted that Richmond should have it.”
            <span id="dots"> . . .</span>
            <span id="more">
              A week later there were comments that the publishers of the Logan
              Journal were not happy with Preston’s perspective of the past
              proceedings. As things go, the Preston paper followed Logan’s
              complaints with this: “We have only been asking for fair play and
              if our language is more forcible than polite, it has been called
              for by petty jealousy and kindergarten pique displayed by some
              baseball enthusiasts in this valley.” Preston’s editor, Watkin L.
              Roe, a man of many words, always seemed able to give as good as he
              got. The members of the Preston League Team of 1909 were a
              mixture. Not all hailed from Preston. From a picture that Newell
              Hart received he identified possible players as Bill Haworth, Phil
              Margetts, Henry Head, a Keller from Mink Creek, Bert Harrison, Bob
              Tippets and Miles Parker. Elmer Head was the mascot. Miles Parker
              was the team’s manager and was employed as the railroad agent in
              Preston. Two out of town team members were the pitcher, surname of
              Smith, and the catcher Red Settes. Information on these players is
              scarce, some not at all. Phil Margetts was a very active part of
              the development of this area it seems, a business man, active in
              theatricals, a musician with evidence of playing both drums and
              violin. He also had a touring troupe that provided programs at the
              Opera House and other communities. Teams from the north end of
              Cache Valley that have appeared in the research of that time are
              ones from Fairview, Mound Valley and Dayton. It is sensible to
              assume the other villages had teams, since the sport was popular
              throughout this area. Most of the last names of those players that
              are identified in existing pictures are still prevalent in our
              county in the 21st Century. Again, these were players of the game,
              but lived full lives in their own communities as businessmen,
              farmers, active in their chosen church affiliations. Baseball was
              a part of everyday life for young and old. The Franklin County
              Citizen of April 1912, writes that the Oneida Academy baseball
              squad was busy practicing on the campus. Ward histories from all
              over Franklin County speak of the various communities celebrating
              Memorial Day, July 4, Pioneer Day on July 24. They all had a huge
              feast, pot luck style, games for the younger ones and the big
              event – a baseball game for entertainment. Village against
              village. Most of these players were only interested amateurs, who
              got together on their Saturday afternoons to relax and play some
              ball. However, they were dedicated to the sport and many were very
              good players. The competition provided just as much enthusiasm and
              spirit as did those games that were played for the Cache Valley
              Pennant.</span
