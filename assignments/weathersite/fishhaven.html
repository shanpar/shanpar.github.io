            <h2>Little Fish Haven, Idaho is Paradise for Residents</h2>
            <h4>by Kurt Firedemann, Idaho State Journal</h4>
          </div>

          <p>
            FISH HAVEN, Idaho — It's an undiscovered paradise. Most people who
            drive by recognize the raw beauty of a place ringed by high desert
            mountains and bordered by the shores of a vast natural lake. In
            winter the hills outside this small paradise echo with the sharp
            whine of snow machines and in the summer thousands of tourists ply
            the lake's bright blue waters with water skis or fishing poles. But
            they don't live there. It's different living in Fish Haven. The
            little town sits just on the Idaho side of U.S. Highway 89 tucked in
            between Bear Lake's west side and the mountains. It's not
            technically a city or a town, it's really nothing more than the
            proverbial wide spot in the road. But people call it a town even
            though there isn't a city council, just the Bear Lake County
            Commission that oversees development there. Only 50 to 100 people
            call it home, depending on the weather. Vic Tilt, co-owner of
            Gladys' Place, is one of the few year-around residents and said the
            population drops quickly when things get cold. The winter evacuation
            isn't much of a worry for Tilt, 60, because his store is the only
            one around. The nearest other store is in Montpelier, about 45
            minutes away. Gladys' Place is also only a few minutes from the Utah
            border and has become quite a lottery spot. The little store is the
            third- and fourth-biggest lottery ticket seller in Idaho, selling
            about 500,000 tickets a year. "We've got a whole mall in 1,000
            square feet," Tilt said. Because it is the only business in Fish
            Haven, Gladys' Place sells it all — liquor, groceries, videos,
            tourist gifts and some of the best deli sandwiches around — and also
            serves as post office, Gladys Tilt said. Yep, you guessed it,
            Gladys' Place is 58-year-old Gladys Tilt's place. The Tilts opened
            the little store in April 1994 and have been steeped in tourist fun
            and local tradition ever since. Before 1994 the couple had been
            working for a corporation in Salt Lake City. On one of their
            traditional summer trips they passed through Fish Haven and fell in
            love with the town and Bear Lake. The couple decided to move their
            fifth-wheel camper trailer to the area, bought a piece of ground and
            parked it. That wasn't enough.
            <span id="dots"> . . .</span
            ><span id="more">
              "We were spending almost every bit of free time we had up here,"
              Gladys said. "We heard that the store might be sold and so we
              decided to go for it." They gave up everything in the city — their
              jobs, home, and moved to Fish Haven in just a few months. "We sold
              our house for cash and moved," Vic said. "'We haven't looked back.
              I was born in Salt Lake City, but now you couldn't drag me back."
              Since their move, Fish Haven has begun to grow up around them. It
              was already a small tourist spot, but since the introduction of
              Bear Lake West, a cabin development south of Fish Haven, things
              have really begun to grow. It's the reason Ruth and Scott Stokes
              are now spending more of their time in Fish Haven. The Stokeses
              have a home in Ogden but are considering making the town along
              Bear Lake's western shore their permanent home. The couple
              discovered the spot because Scott Stokes is a contractor and began
              helping a fellow builder put together cabins in Bear Lake West.
              The Stokeses fell in love with the people and the atmosphere in
              Fish Haven. "It's just a wonderful place to be," Ruth Stokes said.
              "I feel at peace here. Every time we drive up I'm just in awe." It
              was good enough for Scott Stokes and his company, Scott
              Construction, to begin building cabins without his friend. "It's a
              great place to live," he said with a smile. "I just want to help
              people live here." The Bear Lake Regional Commission wants to draw
              people to Fish Haven as well, said Judy Holbrook, regional
              commission executive assistant. The commission is working to
              promote the area and the entire Bear Lake valley, which includes
              towns as far north as Montpelier. "'We're a gateway to
              Yellowstone," she said. "A lot of people drive through here and we
              want to try and capture that tourist traffic." But the problem
              now, is not drawing people to it, Holbrook said, but controlling
              the growth. "We have more than 400 homes in two subdivisions
              around Bear Lake," she said. "We need to maintain our quality of
              life and at the same time encourage growth." But for Vic and
              Gladys Tilt, more or fewer people in Fish Haven isn't really a
              concern. They're content right now. "It's the way it is and the
              way it's always going to be right now," Vic said. "It will be here
              a long time after we're gone."
