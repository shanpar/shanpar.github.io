            <h2>Developing Town: Preston Passionate for CV Pennant</h2>
            <h4>by Claudia Erickson Citizen Correspondent</h4>
          </div>

          <p>
            The Cache Valley Pennant was an item to be prized by the teams
            playing in that crazy year when Preston citizens of all ages and
            both genders were “nuts about baseball.” Feelings ran high and the
            editors of the local newspapers added fuel to the fire with their
            sports editorials from the south end of Cache Valley in Logan to the
            north with Preston’s diatribe.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the August 5, 1909 edition of the Preston News a headline read
            “Preston Robbed of Pennant“ and the following article stated facts
            (as seen from this side of the fence.) “The enmity of Cache Valley
            towns is plainly seen in the action taken ….A coterie of partisan
            baseball directors got together and by pooling their interests,
            literally robbed Preston of the Cache Valley Pennant. All year
            Preston has played the crowds, the umpires and policemen and never
            uttered a word of protest and even won a great majority of the games
            than any other team, but when it came to the final decision, Logan,
            Lewiston and Richmond got together and voted that Richmond should
            have it.”
          </p>

          <p>
            A week later there were comments that the publishers of the Logan
            Journal were not happy with Preston’s perspective of the past
            proceedings. As things go, the Preston paper followed Logan’s
            complaints with this: “We have only been asking for fair play and if
            our language is more forcible than polite, it has been called for by
            petty jealousy and kindergarten pique displayed by some baseball
            enthusiasts in this valley.” Preston’s editor, Watkin L. Roe, a man
            of many words, always seemed able to give as good as he got.
          </p>

            The members of the Preston League Team of 1909 were a mixture. Not
            all hailed from Preston. From a picture that Newell Hart received he
            identified possible players as Bill Haworth, Phil Margetts, Henry
            Head, a Keller from Mink Creek, Bert Harrison, Bob Tippets and Miles
            Parker. Elmer Head was the mascot. Miles Parker was the team’s
            manager and was employed as the railroad agent in Preston. Two out
            of town team members were the pitcher, surname of Smith, and the
            catcher Red Settes. Information on these players is scarce, some not
            at all. Phil Margetts was a very active part of the development of
            this area it seems, a business man, active in theatricals, a
            musician with evidence of playing both drums and violin. He also had
            a touring troupe that provided programs at the Opera House and other
            communities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Teams from the north end of Cache Valley that have appeared in the
            research of that time are ones from Fairview, Mound Valley and
            Dayton. It is sensible to assume the other villages had teams, since
            the sport was popular throughout this area. Most of the last names
            of those players that are identified in existing pictures are still
            prevalent in our county in the 21st Century. Again, these were
            players of the game, but lived full lives in their own communities
            as businessmen, farmers, active in their chosen church affiliations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Baseball was a part of everyday life for young and old. The Franklin
            County Citizen of April 1912, writes that the Oneida Academy
            baseball squad was busy practicing on the campus. Ward histories
            from all over Franklin County speak of the various communities
            celebrating Memorial Day, July 4, Pioneer Day on July 24. They all
            had a huge feast, pot luck style, games for the younger ones and the
            big event – a baseball game for entertainment. Village against
            village. Most of these players were only interested amateurs, who
            got together on their Saturday afternoons to relax and play some
            ball. However, they were dedicated to the sport and many were very
            good players. The competition provided just as much enthusiasm and
            spirit as did those games that were played for the Cache Valley
            Pennant.
